🖥️ ESXi VMX Scanner (PowerShell) 🚀
🔍 What does it do?
ESXi VMX Scanner (PowerShell) is your ultimate VMX detective 🕵️‍♂️ for vCenter datastores! This script hunts down .vmx and .vmtx files across an ESXi datastore, deciphers whether they're registered VMs or ghostly remnants 👻, and logs everything into a neat CSV file.

✨ How it Works:
⚡ Connects to your vCenter using PowerCLI
📂 Scans your specified datastore for VMX files
🧐 Investigates if the VM is registered or lost in the void
💾 Copies VMX files locally for safekeeping
📊 Logs & Displays results in a cool console output
👋 Disconnects from vCenter like a polite guest
